# ML Model Results

## Overview
When trained on 80% of [QMOF Database v8](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/QMOF_Database/13147324/8), the testing set ML results are as follows:
 
| Method | MAE (eV) | R^2 | ρ |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Mean of Dataset | 0.960 | --- | --- |
| Sine Matrix Eigenspectrum | 0.542 ± 0.009 | 0.622 ± 0.016 | 0.787 ± 0.009 |
| Stoichiometric-45 | 0.464 ± 0.005 | 0.709 ± 0.007 | 0.827 ± 0.003 |
| Stoichiometric-120 | 0.457 ± 0.005 | 0.732 ± 0.010 | 0.836 ± 0.007 |
| Orbital Field Matrix | 0.417 ± 0.003 | 0.756 ± 0.010 | 0.865 ± 0.006 |
| Average SOAP kernel | X ± | X ± | X ± |
| CGCNN | 0.255 ± 0.007 | 0.892 ± 0.005 | 0.941 ± 0.003 |
