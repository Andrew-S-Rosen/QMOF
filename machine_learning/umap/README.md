The following folders contain scripts to carry out the UMAP analyses.

Pre-requisite installation instructions:
`pip install umap`
`pip install umap-learn[plot]`

`umap_soap_CSD_13058`: UMAP (w/ SOAP similarity kernel) of CSD-13058-SP dataset with DFT-optimizd band gap data overlaid

`umap_meredig_CSD_13058`: UMAP (w/ Stoichiometric-120 encodings) of CSD-13058-SP with DFT-optimized band gap data or max(Z) overlaid

`umap_meredig_CSD_42362`: UMAP (w/ Stoichiometric-120 encodings) of CSD-42362 with CSD-13058-SP overlaid

`umap_meredig_CoRE_CSD_13058`: UMAP (w/ stoichiometric-120 encodings) of CoRE 2019 overlaid on the CSD-13058-SP dataset
