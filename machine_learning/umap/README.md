The following folders contain scripts to carry out the UMAP analyses.

Pre-requisite installation instructions: `pip install umap` and `pip install umap-learn[plot]`

- `umap_soap_QMOF_14482`: UMAP (w/ SOAP similarity kernel) of QMOF-14482-SP dataset with DFT-optimizd band gap data overlaid
- `umap_meredig_QMOF_14482`: UMAP (w/ Stoichiometric-120 encodings) of QMOF-14482-SP with DFT-optimized band gap data or max(Z) overlaid
- `umap_meredig_QMOF_42349`: UMAP (w/ Stoichiometric-120 encodings) of QMOF-42362 with QMOF-14482-SP overlaid
- `umap_meredig_CoRE_QMOF_14482`: UMAP (w/ stoichiometric-120 encodings) of CoRE 2019 overlaid on the QMOF-14482-SP dataset
