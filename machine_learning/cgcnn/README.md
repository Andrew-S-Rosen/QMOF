Please see https://github.com/arosen93/cgcnn for more details on how to run CGCNN. The  `run_train.sh` and `run_predict.sh` files are sample scripts to train a model and make predictions using a trained model, respectively.

In general, we recommend using [MatDeepLearn](https://github.com/vxfung/MatDeepLearn) if you are interested in training graph neural networks given its superior features.
