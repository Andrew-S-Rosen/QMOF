## Overview
The Quantum MOF (QMOF) Database is a publicly available dataset of quantum-chemical properties for metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and coordination polymers derived from high-throughput periodic density functional theory calculations.

## Structures to Remove
Please see [poor_fidelity.txt](poor_fidelity.txt) for a list of structures that will be removed from the QMOF Database in the next release due to poor structural fidelity (e.g. missing H atoms or counterions).
