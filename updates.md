This file documents all updates to the QMOF database on Figshare.

# Current version
[v5](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13147324). Total size: 15,713 structures (14,482 de-duplicated).

# Changelog
- [v5](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/QMOF_Database/13147324/5): Release corresponding to the forthcoming published paper. No changes to the database compared to v3. Fixes a bug in `get_subset.py` that did not correctly write out the updated `.json` file. 2/13/21.
- [v4](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/QMOF_Database/13147324/4): No changes to the database compared to v3. Includes a few minor typo fixes and better `.xlsx` reader. 1/12/21.
- [v3](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/QMOF_Database/13147324/3): Added CM5 partial charges for every structure and 3000+ Bader charges (and spin densities). Patched some minor bugfixes with the unrelaxed properties for a few MOF structures, deprecated a few structures, and flagged more duplicates. Continued restructuring of main QMOF database for increased useability. 12/23/20.
- [v2](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/QMOF_Database/13147324/2): ~1500 new structures with pore-limiting diameter greater than 2.4 Ã…, computed using Zeo++ prior to structure relaxation, were added to the QMOF database along with their DFT-computed properties. The cap on the maximum number of atoms per primitive cell was raised from 150 to 300. 12/05/20.
- [v1](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/QMOF_Database/13147324/1): Initial release corresponding to the QMOF database [pre-print](https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13147616). 10/28/20.
